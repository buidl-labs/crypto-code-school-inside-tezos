### Intro
There's one thing that we haven't done yet - access contract storage of type big_map or map.
Let's go and learn in this chapter, how to access big_maps in the Tezos blockchain.

### Study time
If you try to access a storage variable of type big_map, it'll show you a random numerical string.
Our contract for `Cyber_Token` has three big_maps, one of them being the `ledger` that stores the amount and type of tokens that each account has. 

If you try accessing `ledger` as a normal variable - 
```javascript
Tezos.contract.at("KT1QECVYeUcy1EocvZvzbzA51oV6QcwCB5uY")
.then(contract => {
    return contract.storage()
})
.then(storage => {
    print(storage.ledger) // will output a random string.
})
```
The console output will show you a random numerical string, but why is this?
Because, big_maps are not stored at the same place as the contract, only a reference id to the big_map is stored in the contract.

But why even bother with this? 
Big_maps are serialized and deserialized only and only when needed. Hence, they result in an optimal usage of resources. 
On a blockchain, resources are expensive, each bit of data costs you, each operation costs you. 
Less usage of resources = money saved.

So how do you access a big_map?
By accessing specific keys along with javascript promises.

You can use `.get(key)` to access a value on the big_map, but it'll still give you a `pending promise` - either use `.then` or `async/await` to wait till the promise resolves and gives you a result.
```javascript
Tezos.contract.at("KT1QECVYeUcy1EocvZvzbzA51oV6QcwCB5uY")
.then(contract => {
    return contract.storage()
.then(storage => {
    //returning a promise that'll resolve to give you the value of the key you provide.
    return storage.ledger.get("tz1Q654L2qnt5mDM1Lbi4rMSTtnE5JHvD8M7")
    .then( res => {
      print(res)
    })      
})       
```
Here we're accessing how many tokens a specified account has in our `Cyber_Token` contract.


### #buidl-ing time
 
#### New feature request!
After you sent 2 tokens to your friend in the previous chapter, you want to double-check the amount of tokens you're left with. 

#### Step by step walkthrough
1. Return the contract's storage.
2. Access and return the value of your account in the `ledger`. Use `storage.ledger.get(account_address)` with your account's address as `account_address`(`tz1Q654L2qnt5mDM1Lbi4rMSTtnE5JHvD8M7`)
