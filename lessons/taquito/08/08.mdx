## Intro
Now your society is starting to function well. 

But there has to be a way to monitor your civilization right? 

How else are you supposed to run your society if you don't know what's happening!?

In this chapter, we'll explore how you can access contract storage through Taquito.

## Study time
Each contract has a global storage that holds all the data that is needed in the contract. For example, our `Cyber_Token` holds `administrator` and `ledger` among other fields.

Contract storage can also be accessed through the `contract` object that we get back through `Tezos.contract.at`.
```javascript
Tezos.contract.at("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>")
.then(contract => {
    return contract.storage();
})
.then(storage => {
    print(storage)
})
.catch(error => print(error));
```
Once you get access to the `contract` object you simply have to return the `contract.storage()` - you'll get the storage of that contract as a result. 

> Note - The data types map and big_map are not accessile as normal. We'll see a couple chapters down the line how to access them in the storage through Taquito.

### Show me an example
We've deployed this example for you and made a few operations on it as well - 
```python
import smartpy as sp

class Wallet(sp.Contract):
    def __init__(self, initial_amount, owner_address):
        self.init(
            amount = sp.mutez(initial_amount),
            owner = owner_address,
            transactions = sp.list(),
            test = {
                "first": "1",
                "second": "2"
            }
        )
        
    @sp.entry_point
    def add_transaction(self, amount):
        self.data.amount += amount
        self.data.transactions.push(amount)
        
@sp.add_test(name = "Wallet")
def test():
    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
    account_owner = sp.test_account("Wallet Example Account")
    w = Wallet(initial_amount = 1000, owner_address = account_owner.address)
    scenario += w
```

<br />

Now let's try accessing the storage of this smart contract.
```javascript
Tezos.contract.at("KT1CTQ7CteorSXcKZPRcZqt2G8gCkPA3YbsA")
.then(contract => {
    return contract.storage();
})
.then(storage => {
    print(storage)
})
.catch(error => print(error));
```
We'll get a result similar to - 
```json
{
  "amount": "1500",
  "owner": "tz1PNnMSshdD4KCt8T1khDnxUcjFTvsk8BnM",
  "transactions": [
    "200",
    "300"
  ]
}
```


## #buidl-ing time
 
### New feature request!
You need to keep a check on your civilization, to make sure they don't start minting a different token(currency) other than what you're minting.

You'll need to access `all_tokens` inside the contract storage of the `Cyber_Token` contract you originated.

### Step by step walkthrough
1. Replace the `"<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>"` with the address of the contract you orginated.
2. Return the contract storage.
3. Initialize `numTokens` as `all_tokens` present in the `storage`.
4. Print to the console : `numTokens == 1`
