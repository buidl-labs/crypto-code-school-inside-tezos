### Intro

In this one we're going to play around a bit with calling an entry point whose arguments are relatively complex through Taquito to help you see and understand how to construct parameters like these.

### Study time

In this chapter we'll call the `transfer` entry point of the `Cyber_Token` contract we deployed.
Even if you didn't know what arguments the `transfer` entry point takes, by looking at the JSON Code for this entry point you can faintly deduce what sort of arguments it requires - 
```json=
{
"prim": "list",
"args": [
  {
    "prim": "pair",
    "args": [
      { "prim": "address", "annots": [ "%from_" ] },
      {
        "prim": "list",
        "args": [
          {
            "prim": "pair",
            "args": [
              { "prim": "address", "annots": [ "%to_" ] },
              { "prim": "pair", "args": [ { "prim": "nat", "annots": [ "%token_id" ] }, { "prim": "nat", "annots": [ "%amount" ] } ] }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "annots": [ "%txs" ]
      }
    ]
  }
],
"annots": [ "%transfer" ]
}
```
If you stare at it long enough, you'll start seeing familiar terms like - `from_`, `nat`, `address`, etc...
Basically, `transfer` accepts a list. Inside the list every item is a nested pair - 
1. `from_` - this simply holds the address of the account from where the tokens have to be sent.
2. `txs` - It's short for "transactions". Each item in the `txs` list has 3 fields - 
    1. `to_` - Address of the recieving account.
    2. `token_id` - To specify which token to transfer.
    3. `amount` - Number of tokens to transfer.

Now, how would you go about calling the entry point - 
```javascript=
contract.methods.transfer([
          {
            from_: "tz1YLnvKy2ycBZ9TpTCv9ngXd1eUw2uxzhDd",
            txs: [{ to_: "tz1Q654L2qnt5mDM1Lbi4rMSTtnE5JHvD8M7", token_id: 0, amount: 2 }]
          }
        ]).send()
```
Let's break this down - `transfer` accepts a list and each list item has two fields `from_` and `txs` as seen in the snippet above.
In all our previous experience, we didn't have to specifically tell Taquito which arugment belongs to which field - but in this example our data is fairly nested(the data inside `txs` list is 3 levels deep) and in nested data specifying fields becomes a necessity.

The question that might arise is, why does `transfer` accept a list? Becuase it can perform **batch operations**, i.e. - handle multiple transactions in an atomic manner in one entry point call. 
We can have multiple transactions in one `transfer` call as well.

Another helpful function that can help us debug our arguments better is `.toTransferParams()`.
```javascript=
let inspectArguments = contract.methods.transfer([
          {
            from_: "tz1YLnvKy2ycBZ9TpTCv9ngXd1eUw2uxzhDd",
            txs: [{ to_: "tz1Q654L2qnt5mDM1Lbi4rMSTtnE5JHvD8M7", token_id: 0, amount: 2 }]
          }
        ]).toTransferParam();
        
print(inspectArguments);
```
`.toTransferParams` creates a nice object which you can look at to see if the arguments are being passed in as you want them to.

#### New feature request!
Your oldest friend has called for help. 
In a land far far away he fought his battle against the aliens and saved thousands of lives. 
Like you, he's starting his own civilization. 
But he needs your help getting the economy started, **he's requested you send him 3 Cyber Tokens**.

#### Step by step walkthrough
1. Transfer 2 tokens of `token_id` 0 from your previous account(`tz1Q654L2qnt5mDM1Lbi4rMSTtnE5JHvD8M7`)(the one you used while minting the tokens) to this account - ``, which you generated right now. Take reference from the code snippet we explored above.
