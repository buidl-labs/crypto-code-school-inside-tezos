### Intro
The time has finally come to originate our contract, finally.

### Study time

It's a super straightforward process to origiante a contract using Taquito - all you need to do is give it the `CODE_JSON` and `STORAGE_JSON`, rest it handles under the hood for you.


### Show me an example
> Note: You need to use `print` as a replacement of `console.log` to output content on our platform
```javascript
Tezos.contract.originate({
        code: CODE_JSON,
        init: STORAGE_JSON
    }).then(origination => {
        print(`Origination waiting confirmation...`);
        return origination.contract()
    }).then(contract => {
        print(`Origination completed.`);
        print(`Contract: ${contract.address}`)
    })
    .catch(error => print(error))
```
First, we're giving it the `CODE_JSON` and `STORAGE_JSON`.
After that, it's mostly the necessary steps - it returns an origination operation, this it the intermediate step where you've sent your contract for origination and waiting for confirmation.
Next, when you get the origination confirmation back, we're returning the originated contract to the next block.

### #buidl-ing time
 
#### Step by step walkthrough
- Originate the contract using `Tezos.contract.originate` and pass it the `CODE_JSON` and `STORAGE_JSON` (use the code snippet present above).
**- Don't forget to copy/store the contract address that's being printed to the console, we'll use it in the next few chapters!** 

In a React application you would ideally store the resultant contract as a state variable but we're not choosing to do that to keep this tutorial as isolated as possible from your framework/environment of choice.
