## Intro

In this module, there are no right answers :P 

We'll take you through the whole process of originating(or deploying) a smart contract on the Tezos blockchain using Javascript, but, we'll complete a chapter complete when you click on 'Next'.

Doesn't mean we've left you high and dry, we got your back. 
You can always check reference code from the "Show Answer" tab!

On this adventure, we'll use the <span class="string-highlight">Taquito library</span> - library for development on the Tezos blockchain.

And, we'll deploy and interact with `Cyber_Token` - our very own fungible token that we learned how to develop in the previous module.

## Study time
Taquito is a library that makes it really easy to make DApps over the Tezos blockchain.
It can do a whole range of things - 
- Originate a smart contract
- Check the balance of an account
- Estimate the amount of tezos needed to originate a contract
- Call an entry point
- Check contract's global storage

<br />

There's a few more to it but these are the features that we'll explore in this module.

The code we'll write can work both in the browser and the Node environment, so we won't show you how to wire this up with the UI or a CLI but you can essentially drop the code right into a React or Vue app and it should work without any issues.


In this chapter we'll start our journey by creating a Tezos testnet account which we'll use to originate our contracts and will set it up in the code.

### Show me an example
To install taquito - 
```shell
npm install @taquito/taquito // or yarn add @taquito/taquito
```
Importing the `Tezos` object - 
```javascript
import { TezosToolkit } from `@taquito/taquito`
```
Almost all the magic happens through the `TezosToolkit` object we imported right here.

## #buidl-ing time
 
### New feature request!
You've made quite a few smart contracts so far but now it's time to originate them - for that you need to create an account on the testnet and set it up.

### Step by step walkthrough

> Note: We're already imported `TezosToolkit` and initialized a bunch of other stuff to make this whole journey a little bit smoother for you.

#### 1. Generate your faucet account -     
1. Visit the Tezos Faucet - https://faucet.tzalpha.net
2. Click on "Get testnet êœ©" (will explain "testnet" in a future chapter)
3. Copy and save the whole JSON output it gives you, this  data basically signifies your account on the testnet.
4. Set the JSON obtained in the previous step as the `FAUCET_KEY` in the code which is a constant(use the `const` keyword).
5. Activate the testnet account.
    1. Head over to https://smartpy.io/dev/wallet.html
    2. Click on "Faucet Accounts" and then "Faucet Importer".
    3. Paste the JSON recieved from the Tezos Faucet in the visible textarea.
    4. Hit "Compute your private key".
    5. Click "Save Account in Wallet" - this isn't necessary but saving the account in wallet will later give you easy access to all the contracts deployed from this testnet account through the SmartPy explorer.
    6. Finally, click "Activate account".
6. Print the `FAUCET_KEY.pkh` to the console, this is the address of your account.
