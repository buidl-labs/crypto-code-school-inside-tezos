### Intro
How do you plan on winning the war if you can't order `powerups` from the Market?
**Inter-contract calling** is here to save us.
It can make your smart contracts go *super saiyan* 🔥.


### Study time
Inter-contract calling is simply the method of invoking the entry point of a contract, from another smart contract.
This means, your `Cryptobot` will be able to call an entry point that exists in `Market`.

Inter-contract calling not only **helps two contracts talk to each other** but also allows your smart contracts to **access off-chain data**(data not stored on the blockchain) through **oracles**.

> Note - You can learn about oracles through this [article](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/blockchain-oracles-explained).

To implement inter-contract calling, you need to understand `sp.transfer` first. As the name suggests it transfers some data and amount to a destination contract(this is what calls the desired entry point).
```python
sp.transfer(data_to_be_sent, amount_of_tezos, destination_contract)
```
It calls the destination contract with `data_to_be_sent` as a parameter while sending the specified `amount_of_tezos` to it.
`destination_contract` needs to be of type, `sp.TContract` created with `sp.contract`.
```python
sp.contract(t, address, entry_point = "")
```
Don't worry if it looks overwhelming at first glance, we're going to break it down :)

`sp.contract` takes three arguments - 
1. `t` - it's the **type** of data that the contract is accepting. `t` has to match the type of `data_to_be_sent` in the `sp.transfer`.
2. `address` - this specifies the adress of the contract inside which you'll be calling an entry point. Needs to be of the type `sp.TAdress`.
3. `entry_point` - this is to specify exactly which entry point you want to call in the contract.

The result of `sp.contract` is passed to `destination_contract` in `sp.transfer`.

```python
@sp.entry_point
def send(self):

    target_contract = sp.contract(sp.TString, 
    self.data.target_address, 
    entry_point = "recieve").open_some()

    data_to_be_sent = "This message should be sent!"
    sp.transfer(data_to_be_sent, 
                sp.mutez(0), 
                target_contract)
```

- This entry point calls the `recieve` entry point in the `target` contract with the data `"This message should be sent!"` as the parameter to `recieve`.
- `.open_some` chained to `sp.contract` simply checks if the specified entry point in the `target` contract is accepting a string(the specified data type which is the first argument to `sp.contract`) or not.
- Look how the type of `data_to_be_sent` matches the type specified in `sp.contract`, this is mandatory.


The full example below will clear up things even more :dart: 

### Show me an example
```python
class Sender(sp.Contract):
   
	def __init__(self, target_address):
		self.init(target = target_address)
	
	@sp.entry_point
	def send(self, payload):
	    data_type = sp.TRecord(payload = sp.TString)
	    c = sp.contract(data_type, self.data.target, entry_point = "recieve").open_some()
	    data_to_be_sent = sp.record(payload = payload)
	    sp.transfer(data_to_be_sent, sp.mutez(0), c)

class Target(sp.Contract):
	def __init__(self):
	    self.init(msg = "")
	
    @sp.entry_point
	def recieve(self, params):
		self.data.msg = params.payload
		
@sp.add_test(name = "Test")
def test():
    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
    test_target = Target()
    scenario += test_target
    test_sender =  Sender(target_address = test_target.address)
    scenario += test_sender
    scenario += test_sender.send('this should be sent to target.')
    
    scenario.verify(test_target.data.msg == 'this should be sent to target.')
```

This is a bare-bones example, we covered the `send` function in the section above but now let's see how it all works together.

1. In the `test` we pass in the address of the target to the `Sender`.
2. Inside the `Sender` contract, we're calling the `receive` entry point present inside the `Target` contract.
3. `recieve` entry point simply assigns `msg` the value it's being sent as the `payload`.

    
### #buidl-ing time

#### New feature request!
It's time to build the functionality of buying a powerup from the `Market` finally 🚀
Let's give our `Cryptobot` the ability to buy a `powerup`.

#### Step by step walkthrough
1. Accept `market_address` as an arugment for `Cryptobot` and initialize the `Cryptobot` with `market_address` equal to `market.address`.(Look at the example above to see how we store `target_address` inside the `Sender` contract.)
2. Add `active_powerup` to `Cryptobot`'s contract storage and initialize it to be a record which holds -
    1. power which is an empty string
    2. duration which is equal to 0
    

5. Implement `buy_powerup` inside `Cryptobot`
    - Define `data_type` as a record which holds a variable called `powerup` of type string.
    - Define the `market_contract` using `Market's` address that is pointed at the entry point `send_powerup` and accepts a data type of string. Don't forget about `.open_some()`
    - Reduce 3000 mutez from `mutez_points` in `Cryptobot` as each `powerup` costs 3000 mutez.
    - Define `data_to_be_sent` which is a record inside which a variable `powerup` is to be set equal to the parameter accepted through the function.
    - Finally, send the `data_to_be_sent` to the Market(`market_contract`) using `sp.transfer` along with 0 Mutez.


> In the coming chapters we'll implement `send_powerup` in `Market` and `recieve_powerup` in `Cryptobot`.

#### Testing our code

- Invoke `buy_powerup` with `"time_freeze"` as the argument and add it to the scenario.
- Use `scenario.verify` to confirm whether `mutez_points` in `Cryptobot` are equal to 2000 mutez.
