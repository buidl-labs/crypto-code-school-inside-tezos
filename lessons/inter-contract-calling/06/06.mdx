### Intro
We'll take a short detour from inter-contract calling to learn and explore a few other topics that will help you build the `Cryptobot` of your dream to absolutely dominate the war against the aliens :star-struck:

In this one we'll cover a slew of different topics including `sub_entry_point` and `sp.for`.

### Study time
#### 1. Sub entry point
Sub entry points allow you to define functions in a smart contract that can **ONLY** be called from other entry points of the same contract.
But why would you even need something like this?
1. **Modularization** - Break down your code into different pieces to keep the code in your entry points clean and to the point. Makes the code easier to maintain and more readable.
2. **Re-usability** - Once implemented, you can use them where ever needed. I think of them as **utility functions** that play a role in the success of other functions but aren't of much use indepedently.

Here's how you define a sub entry point - 
```python=
@sp.sub_entry_point
def double(self, x):
    sp.result(x * 2)
```
Notice, **`sp.result`** is used to return from a sub entry point instead of `return`.

And it can be invoked like this - 
```python=
@sp.entry_point
def update_result(self, num):
    # Assume double is a sub entry point already implemented in the smart contract.
    self.data.result = self.double(num)
```
Sub entry points can access the contract storage - if your function doesn't need to access the contract storage, you should use [`sp.global_lamba` ](https://smartpy.io/dev/reference.html#_lambdas).

**2. Looping with `sp.for`**
Remember how we needed to use `sp.if` instead of `if` in SmartPy?
Similarly, `for` and `while` have their SmartPy counter-parts as `sp.for` and `sp.while`.
```python=
transfers = [-12, 15, -10, 20, 30]
sp.for transfer in transfers:
    self.data.total += transfer
```
You need to use `sp.range` instead of `range`.

**3. Local variables using `sp.local`**
You can define local variables in SmartPy using `sp.local` - 
```python=
total = sp.local("total", 0)
```
But why not just define a normal python variable like - `total = 0`?
Because normal python variables can't be updated during execution of a smart contract but variables defined using `sp.local` can be updated.
- First argument to `sp.local` is the name which will be used to refer to the variable in error message.
- Second argument is the initial value.

**Value of a local variable is accessed through `.value`** - 
```python=
x = sp.local("x", 0)
# now to access or modify the value of x, you need to use `x.value`
x.value = 2
x.value += 5
# x.value is now 7.
```

This is mostly helpful with loops wherever you need to keep track of something.
Don't worry, we'll use this in our `Market` smart contract. That'll bring more clarity.

### Show me an example
```python=
@sp.sub_entry_point
def add_to_total_received(self, amount):
    self.data.total_received += amount
    
@sp.entry_point
def calculate_received(self):
    sp.for transaction in self.data.transactions:
        sp.if transaction.action == "received":
            self.add_to_total_received(transaction.amount)
```

Imagine this as a part of a `Ledger` smart contract. 
We've got an entry point `calculate_received` that loops over the transactions, if the transaction was received - it adds the amount to the total through the sub entry point `add_to_total_received`.

### #buidl-ing time
 
#### New feature request!
We'll have to help the `Market` peeps find which `powerup` we want before they can send it over to your `Cryptobot`.

Let's put our knowledge of sub entry point and loops to use :rocket: 

#### Step by step walkthrough
- Implement the sub entry point `find_powerup` in the `Market` contract.
    1. Define a local variable called `powerup_to_send` which should be a record which holds a variable called power(equal to an empty string) and another variable called duration(equal to 0).
    2. Loop through the `powerups` in the contract storage.
    3. Inside the loop, if it matches the `powerup` we're looking for set `powerup_to_send` equal to the `powerup`.
    4. Return the value of `powerup_to_send`(remember to use `sp.result`).
