### Intro
Awesome work defeating those nasty aliens :rocket: 
But, beware that was only the **first wave**, there's a greater challenge that lies ahead of you.
At least one good thing came out of the first battle, you managed to collect some **mutez** :dollar: when you defeated the first wave.

Confused what good is this **mutez** thingy? 
It's a **smaller unit of XTZ**. 
Simply a way to represent smaller amounts of Tezos.

This will come in handy to defeat the new challenge coming your way. 
You'll can use these `mutez_points` to buy power-ups from the `Market`(we'll implement the market in the coming chapters).


### Study time
Mutez is to XTZ(Currency of Tezos) what a cent is to dollar or what gram is to kg.
To be more accurate - 
`1,000,000 mutez = 1 XTZ`(1 million Mutez = 1 Tez(or XTZ))

Similar to all other data types in SmartPy(sp.TNat, sp.TMap, etc) there are Tezos specific data types as well and one of them is [`sp.TMutez`](https://smartpy.io/dev/reference.html#_mutez).

> #### Note - 
> In SmartPy, when a type is being specified - it's referened with `sp.T<Type>`. But when it's being called with a value - it's called with `sp.<type>`.
> Example - `sp.TNat` and `sp.nat(5)`, `sp.TMutez` and `sp.mutez(500)`
> If you're not familiar with data types, go through this [chapter](https://cryptocodeschool.in/lesson/chapter-08)

#### Difference between sp.mutez and sp.tez - 
When you write `sp.mutez(100000)` it's equated to `0.1 Tez(XTZ)`.
Hence, when you're specifying a large number of tokens, it's better to use `sp.tez`. Like - `sp.tez(0.1)`.
Whereas, `sp.mutez` helps you express smaller quantities with much better accuracy.

### Show me an example
```python=
class Wallet(sp.Contract):
    def __init__(self, initial_amount):
        self.init(
            amount = sp.mutez(initial_amount)
        )
    
@sp.add_test(name = "Wallet")
def test():
    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
    w = Wallet(1000)
    scenario += w
    scenario.verify(w.data.amount == sp.mutez(1000))
```
Here, `Wallet` is storing `amount` which is of type `sp.TMutez`
In the expression inside `scenario.verify`, `w.data.amount == sp.mutez(1000)`, we need to wrap `1000` with `sp.mutez()` because `amount` is holding data of type `sp.TMutez`.

Think about it - for two values to be equal, their type also needs to be the same because smartpy scripts get converted to **Michelson** which is the language that runs on the Tezos blockchain. **Michelson is stronly typed**, hence requires same types.

### #buidl-ing time

#### New feature request!
Now that you've collected some `mutez_points` in your previous battle, you need to have a place to keep track of them as well.

#### Step by step walkthrough
- Initialize `mutez_points` in your contract storage and set it equal to 5000 mutez.
    
#### Testing our code
- Use `scenario.verify` to confirm whether the `mutez_points` in `Cryptobot` is equal to `5000` or not.
