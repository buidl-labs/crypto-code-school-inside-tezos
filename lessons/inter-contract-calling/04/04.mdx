### Intro
Right now, the system is broken.
You can't afford broken systems, you've got the threat of aliens looming over your head in case you forgot!
You've stored `powerups` in the `Market`, but we've no idea how long a `powerup` lasts. 

Let's fix this with data type provided by SmartPy - [record](https://smartpy.io/dev/reference.html#_records)

### Study time
Records are the kind of structures that seem not of much use at first but turn out to be extremely crucial on taking a closer look, it's the underdog of types 🐶

A record can hold multiple variales of different(or same) types under one namespace and it's represented by the type `sp.TRecord` in SmartPy.

Confused? 
Take a look at the snippet below ⬇️
```python=
money = sp.record(amount = 1000, currency = "$")
```
As I told you before, a record is just multiple variables gathered under one. 

You can access `amount` and `currency` through the following -
```python=
money.amount
money.currency
```

Wondering why can't you use `sp.TMap` to do the same thing?
Because `sp.TMap` only allows the same type of data as values. 

For example, the following `sp.TMap` is invalid and will throw an error - 
```python=
❌ ❌ ❌
money = {
    "amount": 4000,
    "currency": "$"
}
```
This will give you an error because the value of amount is of type `sp.TNat`, while the type of currency is `sp.TString`. The types don't match.

This won't be a problem with records because they're designed to hold multiples values of different data types.

### Show me an example
Following the lead from previous chapters, this example is also building on top of our `Wallet` smart contract.

```python=
class Wallet(sp.Contract):
    def __init__(self, initial_amount, owner_address):
        self.init(
            amount = sp.mutez(initial_amount),
            owner = owner_address,
            transactions = sp.list()
        )
        
    @sp.entry_point
    def add_transaction(self, transaction):
        sp.if transaction.action == "sent":
            self.data.amount -= transaction.amount
        sp.if transaction.action == "recieved":
            self.data.amount += transaction.amount
        self.data.transactions.push(transaction)
    
@sp.add_test(name = "Wallet")
def test():
    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
    account_owner = sp.test_account("Wallet Example Account")
    w = Wallet(initial_amount = 1000, owner_address = account_owner.address)
    scenario += w
    
    scenario += w.add_transaction(sp.record(amount = sp.mutez(500), action = "sent"))
    scenario += w.add_transaction(sp.record(amount = sp.mutez(300), action = "recieved")) 
```
Using records we've revamped the `add_transaction` entry point.
Let's take a closer look.
```python=
    @sp.entry_point
    def add_transaction(self, transaction):
        sp.if transaction.action == "sent":
            self.data.amount -= transaction.amount
        sp.if transaction.action == "recieved":
            self.data.amount += transaction.amount
        self.data.transactions.push(transaction)
```
Now, we're accepting a record that has two fields inside it - `action` and `amount`.
If the `action` is `"recieved"`, we add the `amount`.
If the `action` is `sent` we deduct the `amount`.

But, how do we call this entry point?
Look at the snippet below.
```python=
scenario += w.add_transaction(sp.record(amount = sp.mutez(500), action = "sent"))
```
Passing `sp.record` with the fields inside it to `add_transaction`.

Records seem simple now, don't they!?

### #buidl-ing time
 
#### New feature request!
In the last chapter, we successfuly defined the smart contract for `Market` but we forgot that powerups don't last forever! We listed out the `powerups` in the list but didn't mention the `duration` for them.
It's time to fix it 🔧
#### Step by step walkthrough
1. Edit the `powerups` list inside the `Market` contract to hold two records, both of them will have a `power` field and a `duration` field -


| power(`sp.TString`) | duration(`sp.TNat`) |
| ------------------- | ------------------  |
| "time_freeze"       | 3                   |
| "one_shot_kill"     | 4                   |
`duration` is for how many turns the `powerup` will be in effect.
