### Intro
You've told `Market` which `powerup` you want, but don't you want to get the `powerup` back!?
After all, `powerups` will help you destroy the aliens.

### Study time
So far, we've implemented only one inter-contract call.
But to complete the whole process of buying a powerup, we're going to need one more from `Market` to `Cryptobot` to send the real `powerup`.

![inter-contract call](https://i.imgur.com/JjgArPu.png)

This in loose terms is called **cyclic inter-contract calls**.
- First contract calls the Second contract and then the Second contract calls the First contract.



There's a last piece in the puzzle that you need to understand to implement the full functionality - `sp.to_address`.

`sp.to_address` accepts a contract(`sp.TContract`) and returns the address(`sp.TAddress`) of that contract.

It can be used in combination with `sp.self` to generate the address of the currenty smart contract inside an entry point.
> Note - `sp.self` refers to the contract it's being used inside.
```python=
sp.to_address(sp.self)
```

Super useful for our case because the `Cryptobot` needs to send its own address to `Market` so that the `Market` will know where to send the `powerup` back.

Puzzle clicking together now? :fire: 

### #buidl-ing time
 
#### New feature request!
We're going to have to **buidl** a lot of stuff in this one.
Let's go and complete our whole system so that you can finally use the powerups to blow the nasty alien to pieces
:alien: + :gun: = :boom: & :dollar:

#### Step by step walkthrough
1. Modify `buy_powerup` in `Cryptobot`
    1. Modify `data_type` to also include `cryptobot_address` which is of type `sp.TContract` that accepts a record of string `power` and nat `duration`.
    2. Define `self_contract` - it's the contract that holds the details to `receive_powerup` entry point in `Cryptobot`.
        - accepts a record of same shape as `active_powerup`.
        - address points to `Cryptobot`( use `sp.to_address`)
        - points to `recieve_powerup` entry point.
    3. Modify `data_to_be_sent` to hold `cryptobot_contract` as well, which is equal to `self_contract`.
    
2. Implement `send_powerup` in `Market`
    1. Define `powerup_to_send` as the result of `find_powerup`.
    2. Make an inter-contract call to `cryptobot_contract` and send to it the `powerup_to_send`.
3. Implement `receive_powerup` in `Cryptobot`.
    - Set `active_powerup` equal to the `poweup` being received as the parameter.

#### Testing our code
1. Invoke `Cryptobot.buy_powerup` inside `test` function with the parameter `time_freeze`.
2. Use `scenario.verify` to check whether `mutez_points` held by `Cryptobot` is equal to 2000 mutez.
3. Use `scenario.verify` to check wether the `active_power.power` of `Cryptobot` is `"time_freeze"` or not.
