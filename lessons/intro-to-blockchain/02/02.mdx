## Intro
Blockchain technology can potentially change the world as we know it, in the coming years - in the next few chapters we'll find out why and how.

## Study time

In your life, you deal with money daily and the bank keeps track of your balance for you. 

It is your money, but it's tracked and handled by a third party, the bank. You put trust into the bank that they'll not misuse your money.

What if one day, a <span class="string-highlight">bank decides to betray your trust and uses up your money to save itself from bankruptcy?</span>

This **can not** be the case for Cryptocurrency, because **YOU own and control your money** when it's on the blockchain.

A cryptocurrency is a form of money, a form of digital money.

Where there's money, there needs to be a way to keep track of it - in the case of cryptocurrencies, **blockchain does that for you**.

**Blockchain at its core is a <span class="string-highlight">digital ledger</span>.**

### Blockchain as a ledger:
A ledger is nothing but a collection of records or transactions. 
For example, your bank account is simply a ledger that logs all the transactions you make. And the result of all these transactions reflects on your balance.

Similarly, blockchain keeps a track of all the transactions that happen over it.

A transaction is an event where cryptocurrency is being sent from one account to another, along with some data - this data could be absolutely anything, text, image, etc.


### But what's special about blockchain?
Blockchain is a <span class="string-highlight">**trustless ledger**</span>.

Blockchain **doesn't completely remove** the need for you to depend on an institution, rather it distributes the responsibility among multiple individuals(nodes).

Multiple people(nodes in a blockchain) have a copy of the ledger and are checking if the transaction is valid or not.
 
This takes away the power of playing God from one institution, hence, you can **trust your assets are safe in your crypto wallet**.

> A Crypto Wallet is simply software that allows you to send and receive cryptocurrency, and monitor your balance.

_Because in this system we're relying on everyone, we effectively rely on no one._

That brings us to the next point, blockchain is **distributed**, which makes it so powerful. 

It essentially removes a single point of failure and has mechanisms to ensure that the data isn't being tampered with.

Plus, it doesn't let you delete or edit previous transactions from the blockchain - once it's on the blockchain, it's always going to be there.

If the history can't be manipulated, it makes blockchain **tamper-proof**.

### Problems blockchain solves well:
Almost everything we do is a **cooperation and trust problem** among us humans.
- Working as a freelancer by the hour? Your client trusts you to report the number of hours you worked honestly.
- Selling your car? The buyer trusts that you'll not manipulate the number of kilometers the car has already run.

<br />

Blockchain <span class="string-highlight">solves the problem of cooperation and trust between humans</span> by truly **distributing responsibility** throughout the whole system and being **tamper-proof**, hence, reducing the risk and Intro
