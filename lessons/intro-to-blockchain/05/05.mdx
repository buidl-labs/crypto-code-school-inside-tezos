## Intro

Decentralized applications or dApps are the way forward. They're the applications that will <span class="string-highlight">unlock the next wave of innovation</span>. Developers will utilize the infrastructure laid out by blockchain and build a solution that wasn't even possible a couple of years ago.

In this chapter, let's understand what a dApp is and how it's built.


## Study time

To understand dApps, you'll first need to take a look at how centralized applications are built.

Almost all the applications you use are centralized. Like Facebook, Google, Instagram, etc.

In a centralized app, the data is controlled and centrally stored by the company. 
You have no rights over the data and you have to trust the company to maintain your privacy. 
Also, however tight the security of an app might be, centralized applications are always hack-able. 

If there was a centralized app to keep track of how many fights your Cryptobot has won, a hacker could penetrate the system and change the wins of your Cryptobot to 0. You wouldn't want to own a loser bot :(

This scenario isn't too far from reality, <span class="string-highlight">huge tech giants often get hacked.</span> The recent one being the [Twitter hack where accounts of several well-known people were compromised](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-twitter-hack-election-plan/). 


### Moving on to what decentralized apps are - 
DApps at their core are a user-friendly interface that communicates with the smart contract(s). This interface could be anything, a web app, a mobile app, or even a desktop app.

DApps are powered by a collection of one or more smart contracts that are stored on a blockchain. 

The smart contract + blockchain combination replaces the traditional server backend that is used in the case of traditional apps. 
 
> Reminder: Smart contracts are simply agreements written in code, stored on the blockchain. Follows the IF `x` happens, DO `y` pattern.

This is SO much better than the traditional model because dApps are tamper-proof and don't undergo outages!

Your smart contracts literally can't go down. They run on top of the blockchain, and blockchain is this beast that keeps running 24x7.

The interface the user will interact with is called the `frontend`.
In a typical centralized app, the frontend would communicate with the backend through Rest API calls.

But, the case is different for decentralized apps is different. Depending on which blockchain network you're using, some libraries let you communicate with the smart contract directly from the frontend Javascript code. For example, Taquito for Tezos, Web3.js for Ethereum. 

I know, all this can be a lot to take in. 
But don't doubt yourself, no matter who you are - you can learn to code smart contracts and build on the blockchain the next generation of dApps.

Even the founder of Uniswap, one of the most important dApp right now, was a mechanical engineer who started learning Ethereum when he was laid off from his job. 
Uniswap was a dApp started by one dev, who was an ex-mechanical engineer.
Three years later, it is one of the most important decentralized applications.


In the previous chapters we've discussed the benefits of building on the blockchain - dApps is what allows you to realize this potential. 
dApps are the application of blockchain, similar to how a light bulb is an application of electricity.


It's up to people like you, to <span class="string-highlight">build for the future</span>, on the blockchain.


**Now, it's time for you to get your `Cryptobot` and get started on your journey of becoming a dApp development ninja ðŸ”¥**

The Cryptobot you'll get is an **NFT**, which is a digital asset represented as a token that can be traded on the blockchain. 

This means you can trade Cryptobots for money  ðŸ¤‘

Also, you can customize the Cryptobot as you like, it's your own!
