# Welcome aboard **learners** and **#build-ers**! 

This is is the beginning of **Chapter 1** of **Cryptobots vs Aliens** - an interactive code school that teaches you all you need to know about building applications on the blockchain.

This module is a non-technical intro to the mental models behind blockchain, the real programming starts from next module - this module is getting you ready to #buidl 😎


## Prerequisites for the course 
There are absolutely **zero** pre-requisites for this module, except for the desire to understand this blockchain thingy.
