### Intro
In this module, we're going to be exploring everything tokens. 
You're going to be making your own tokens as well!

But first in this chapter, let's take a deeper dive into what tokens actually are and learn about different types of them.

Feel free to skip this chapter if you're well-versed with tokens.


### Study time
Tokens in the blockchain world are trade-able assets. 
As simple as that, they hold value and may or may not be traded, either like money or like goods depending on which kind of token it is.
Usually they represent something in the eco-system, be it voting rights, ownership of something unique, currency, etc.

There are 2 types that we'll look into - Fungible and Non-fungible tokens.

#### Fungible Tokens
Fungible tokens are similar to money in our physical world.
A 20$ note is equal to all other 20$ bills in value, this is what we call fungibility - mutually interchangeable. 
Similarly, all fungible tokens are equal. 
For example, 1 Tez( Tez is the currency used by Tezos ) is and always will be equal to 1Tez - the value of 1 Tez will always be equal to another.

Another concept in fungibility is that you can divide a token into different amounts and it'll still retain its value. If you divide 1 Tez into two tokens of 0.5 Tez - the total value still remains the same. 
Think of it like this - You can give somebody a 20$ note and get back 2 10$ notes but still be assured that you got the same value back.

#### Non-fungible tokens(NFTs)
Non-fungible tokens are unique tokens that usually represent an asset.
For example, 
1. CryptoKitties uses NFTs to represent different cat graphics - each token has is a different cat character.
2. Cryptovoxels allows you to **buy land** which is an NFT where you can build different buildings and stuff.

Both of these examples show us how NFTs can bring the concept of **true digital ownership** to games because you can truly hold a piece of your character which is yours to keep or trade.
But, NFTs have extreme potential in other use-cases as well.
Imagine, you can tokenize a real estate and sell of fractions of it in form of tokens, similar to [realt.co](https://realt.co)

It's important you understand tokens well, because these will form the basis of the new world you've set out to establish.

In the coming chapter we'll see how to implement both fungible and non-fungible tokens in SmartPy, the thought of making your own token is exciting isn't it!? ⭐️ 

### Quiz time
- Which type of token would you use when making an in-game currency using blockchain, each token will be equal to another in your currency? `fungible` or `non-fungible`?

Write your answer in the `answer` variable on the editor beside.
