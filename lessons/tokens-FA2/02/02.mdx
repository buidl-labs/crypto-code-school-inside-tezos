### Intro
FA2 is the Tezos way of implementing tokens - fungible and non-fungible alike. It's going to play an important role in helping you create a new world, a new society.

The series of following chapters will teach you all you need to know about FA2 to implement tokens using it! üåç


### Study time

FA2 is the standard which defines a set way of how you would go about implementing a token. 

But why do you even need a standard?
1. When you're minting your own tokens, you're essentially playing with money. Now you wouldn't want to have any bug in your code when thousands and thousands of dollars can be affected by it.
2. Even if you end up implementing your tokens safely, how would anybody interact with them if they don't know how to? That's why a standard becomes a necessity because it defines a set of functionality and how to interact with it so that different services can integrate with your token.

FA2 allows for a wide-range of features through its  entry points. 
It even allows you to store `metadata` in a token, kind of how CryptoKitties store a kitty graphic in an NFT.
And how about `operators`? You can give different accounts the permission to trade on behalf of other accounts, how rad is that!?

Don't worry if it doesn't make sense right now, keep going - in the next few chapter when you implement tokens for your civilization, the concepts will start to click.
