### Intro: 

SmartPy is a high-level smart contracts library built to greatly ease the accessibility, understandability and probability of smart contracts that can be used to write and test smart contracts that are deployable on the Tezos blockchain. 

It uses the widely popular programming language Python to reduce the barrier of entry for smart contracts builders and empower a large crowd of potential developers of dApps and other smart contracts to contribute to the Tezos ecosystem.
