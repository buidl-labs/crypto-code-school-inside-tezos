Great job! Now that we've got a shell for our contract, let's learn about how smartpy deals with variables.

We define an initialization method for `Plant` that determines the initial storage during contract origination. `__init__()` accepts one argument, name and calls `self.init()` to assign its value to the newly-created name variable field of type string in the contract’s storage.

SmartyPy does most of type inference automatically in almost all the cases, we can also explicitly define string by using sp.string method

Container constructor names are uncapitalized `(sp.string("peashooter"))` and their types are capitalized: `(sp.TString)`

```python
def __init__(self, name):
    self.init(name = sp.string(name))
```

This contract calls an initialization method `self.init`, contained in `sp.Contract`, that is able to determine an initial storage for the contract and all the state variables are declared in self.init method.

## Put it to code
Now, declare  `__init__` function inside the plant class
```python
def __init__(self, name):
  self.init(name = sp.string(name))
```

**TODO: declare __init__ function **
