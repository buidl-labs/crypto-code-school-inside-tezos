### Intro: 

Now that you know how to define and test your `Cryptobot` contract, time to start giving it small abilities!

Previously you had given the name of <span class="string-highlight">"terminator"</span> to our `Cryptobot` contract. But then, if you come up with a cooler name in the future, how do you go about changing your cryptobot’s name? 

In this chapter, you will learn to add a functionality that enables you to change your cryptobot’s name using entry point functions!  


## Study Time: 

### What are entry point functions? 

Entry functions are basically class methods with the added superpowers to modify a contract's local storage! 

As we learnt about the concept of <span class="string-highlight">"state"</span> and <span class="string-highlight">"state variables"</span> in <br /> [Chapter 5](/lesson/chapter-05), these functions are mainly used to access and modify a contract's state by altering state variables values after the contract is deployed. 

### Show me an example: 

Remember the example of our `Bank` contract from previous chapters:


```python
class Bank(sp.Contract):
   def __init__(self):
       self.init(name = "World Bank")
```

Let us add an entry point function to the above contract so that we can modify `name`'s value:

```python
class Bank(sp.Contract):
   def __init__(self):
       self.init(name = "World Bank")
   
   @sp.entry_point
   def modify_name(self, new_name):
       self.data.name = new_name
```

Explaining the code above:

1. We add a `@sp.entry_point` decorator to instruct the compiler that the following function is an entry point function.  

2. We then define the `modify_name` function and pass `self` and `new_name` as function arguments. 
    * `new_name` will contain the new name that we would pass to this function

3. Then we access `name`, which is a variable stored inside our contract storage, by using `self.data`. 
    * **This is an important concept to remember, for anytime you need to access anything from the contract storage, you need to use `self.data`.**

4. We assign `new_name` to `self.data.name`. 
   * This line of code will change the `name` contents to whatever you send in the `new_name` variable! 

Simple, right? 

Let us use our testing skills that we gained from [Chapter 6](/lesson/chapter-06) to test our newly created `modify_name` function! 


```python
class Bank(sp.Contract):
   def __init__(self):
       self.init(name = "World Bank")
   
   @sp.entry_point
   def modify_name(self, new_name):
       self.data.name = new_name
    
@sp.add_test(name = "Test Bank Contract")
def test():
    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
 
    bank_test_contract =  Bank()
    
    scenario += bank_test_contract
    scenario += bank_test_contract.modify_name("Local Bank")
```

Explaining the code above:

1. We had previously given our `Bank` contract the name of "World Bank". 
2. In our `test` function: 
   * we call the `modify_name` entry point function on `bank_test_contract`, which is an instance of `Bank`
   * and in calling the function we pass the new name i.e <span class="string-highlight">"Local bank"</span>. 

As we know the above testing code simulates how smart contract code will behave once deployed. 

The above code when simulated, will change the `name` variable's content from "World Bank" to "Local Bank"


You can also tinker around with the above code on [SmartPy’s online IDE](https://smartpy.io/demo/index.html?code=eJyNUkFq5DAQvPsVRXKZYYMfEBjIJtc9LuSodKT2RKzcMpImYfL6SO1xbEIWYrBBcndVV3X5cYqpII@UynQGZeSp62ygnHFP8m@Xp_4hSklky_62A@B4gDFefDFmlzkM83V72qlvf3ZCI@OAq8eYglOgq32rau9dheSKeDZT9FIWzDE6P5xN61TYG0yUaMwr_PVM4KgQfMYps0OJIGu5TmsvUyKXmOjIPZa@tZ@P_YrR65CJB04sFQLlhaF3r5Q8PQdWKHZrv5fsHWvhVzrEQXWutF@IDhc9vfCbqtS6ruuaH@ScKZxX4_7Wg@Jhcb8a2GzSqosn2bLUUWNtqBjtj1mudvvuU_o1HhmDTxXRJqbCINQh0DblKfj36mNVVqi6sOoaUhwRTwlPbYwnaCYu6p7rjc5rPssPmPOy5f0trnkleGO4FKd68JtF1eVHZch@PAUqPorKA8urT1FGntOx6vx1@IZ6Q_hAIXg56oI2eYLGDRo3DCexM1WEfSE5zkv_AVG_jeiyxbasP9FS2KQc__18AI8cFc4-).

## #buidl-ing time:

Let’s change our Cryptobot’s name from <span class="string-highlight">"terminator"</span> to <span class="string-highlight">"punky terminator"</span> by doing the following: 

1. Add a `change_name` entry point function just after the scope of `__init__` initialization function finishes. 
     * Pass `self` and `new_name` as arguments to `change_name` function. 
     * Use `self.data.name` to access `Cryptobot` contract’s internal storage. And assign it the value of `new_name`. 

2. Test your newly created `change_name` function by calling `change_name` on `test_bot`. 
      * Pass in <span class="string-highlight">"punky terminator"</span> in `change_name`'s function call.
