Lists are the collection of object/values which are of same type in smartpy.

List in smartPy are of type sp.TList but are initialized in the same manner as in python.
There is no array in SmartPy because they are missing in Michelson, we use maps instead.
example:
`list = []`
Values can be added to the list by using `push` function

Example:
`list.push(value)`
In your contract, list will be used to store all the attacks of your plant which will create a special move.

## Put it to code

1) Remove `power_move` as it is not required now.

1) declare an empty list `special_move` inside the stat record

`special_moves = []`

2) Create a function `createMove` which will take a list of `sp.TPair` type `moves` as parameter and will store that list in `special_moves`.


```python
@sp.entry_point
def createMove(self, params):
    self.data.player[sp.sender].special_move = params.moves
```
