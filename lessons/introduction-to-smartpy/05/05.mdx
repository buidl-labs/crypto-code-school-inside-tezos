Container constructor names are uncapitalized, example: `(sp.int(-42))` and their types are capitalized, example `(sp.TInt)`

 - sp.TInt: The type of integer values, e.g: -42 or sp.int(-42).
 - sp.TNat: The type of non-negative integer values, e.g: sp.nat(42).
 - sp.TIntOrNat: The type of integer values whose type is still undetermined between sp.TInt or sp.TNat, e.g: 42 or sp.intOrNat(42).

In SmartPy, we have three possible types for integer: `int, nat, and intOrNat`. When writing a number (say, 12), as you can see, it can be of type sp.TInt or sp.TNat which makes it important to explicitly mention the type in such cases. If you donâ€™t know whether it is an int or a nat then you type it as intOrNat (sp.TIntOrNat). Its exact type will be determined at a later stage. This determination is necessary for the Michelson compiler because Michelson needs to make this precise determination.

## Put it to code

Now you'll intialize growth_rate attribute and health for your plant to grow.

1) Declare state variables `attack`, `defense`, `growth_rate` and `health` all of type `sp.TNat` and initialize then with 10, 10, 10, 100 respectively
