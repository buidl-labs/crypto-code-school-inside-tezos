### Intro:

In this chapter, we will give our cryptobot a name and store it inside the contract!

Let us break the above down to arrive at what concepts you will be learning: 

1. “Give our cryptobot a name” - we will need to learn about variables. In the world of smart contracts, variables are more commonly referred to as state variables. 
2. “And store it inside the contract” - we will need to learn about the concept of contract storage.  


Let's learn them in the reverse order since that is how the concepts relate with each other. 


## Study Time: 

### What is contract storage?

Think of this as your contract’s personal database. It is used to record the current "state" of the 
of your smart contract by using variables. 

When you deploy the contract on the blockchain, this storage becomes part of the global storage of all the contracts in the world! 


### What is state in smart contract? 

A "state" represents the current status of the smart contract like a visual screenshot. If you'd like your smart contract to do anything - like building shooting ability in your `Cryptobot` contract - it will involve changing the contract's current state. 

### What are state variables? 

State variables act as a single slot in the "contract storage” and are the fundamental unit to record the current state of your smart contract. 

For example: 

```python
bank_contract_storage = {
  'name': "World Bank"
  'money_in_all_accounts': 10000000
}

```
Explaining the code above: 

1. Here `name` and `money_in_all_accounts` act as state variables for bank contract.
2. There values i.e <span class="string-highlight">"World Bank"</span> and <span class="string-highlight">10000000</span> act as the current values of the state. 
3. To change the `name` or `money_in_all_accounts` you will need to change their values i.e altering the contract's current state into a new state. 

```python

### State A: Current State

bank_contract_storage = {
  'name': "World Bank"
  'money_in_all_accounts': 10000000
}

### State B: Reduce money_in_all_accounts by $1

bank_contract_storage = {
  'name': "World Bank"
  'money_in_all_accounts': 9999999
}

### Here we changed values by going from State A to State B. 

```

By looking at current values of contract's storage, you are able to get vantage of the current state of the smart contract. 

These are primarily used to : 

1. query the current state of your contract. 
   * Eg: "What is the current amount of money stored in all accounts in World Bank?" 
2. change current state:
   * Eg: "Reduce amount of money stored in World Bank by $50,000"

by functions inside the contract, which will be learning in [Chapter 7.](/tezos/academy/module-01/chapter-07)


### Example of initializing contract storage:

```python
import smartpy as sp

class Bank(sp.Contract):
    def __init__(self):
        self.init(name = "World Bank")

```

Explaining the code above: 

1. We scaffold the `Bank` contract as we had learnt in the previous chapter. 
2. Next, using `__init__` we define an initialization method for `Bank` that determines the initial storage during contract origination. 
3. `_init_` calls `self.init()` which assigns `name`, a state variable, with <span class="string-highlight">“World Bank”</span> and stores it inside the “contract storage”.

## #buidl-ing time:
Now let us practice what we learned so far and give a name to `Cryptobot` contract`!

1. Using `__init__`, define the initialization function of your `Cryptobot` contract. 
2. Define `name` variable and initialize it’s value with <span class="string-highlight">“terminator”</span> since that is the name of the species of the Cryptobot that you are building.
