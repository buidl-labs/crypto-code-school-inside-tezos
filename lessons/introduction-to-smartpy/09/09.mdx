`Pair` is a unique datatype in smartPy which is nothing but a pair of 2 values. It can be taken as a python tuple with only 2 values. These values can be of any primitive datatype and need not be the same. Its type is also inferred automatically.

To initialize a pair:
```python
example = ("", 0) 
# this will initialize a pair with first element
# as type of sp.TString and second as sp.TInt
```
Elements of a pair can be called by using `sp.fst(..)` to get the first element and `sp.snd(..)` to get the second element.

Example:

```python
sp.fst(example) # this will return the first value
sp.snd(example) # this will return the second value
```

Elements of a `pair` is immutable, that means, you cannot reassign values to it's unique elements.

Example:
```python
sp.fst(test) = "change"
# this will throw an error
```

## Put it to code
Declare and initialize a variable of type `sp.TPair(sp.TString, sp.TInt)` `power_move`, (attack_name, attack_power)

1) Variable name: `power_move`,

2) Name of the move: `Bullet Seed`

3) Attack power: `95`
